# My little website yay

I'm hosting this on a vps, hence the low level language (Go).
I like HATEOS so I'll be using HTMX with some web components if I need to.
I don't really like hidden control flows so I'll do my best to be very descriptive when coding.

# Roadmap

✅ Choose Tech
✅ Setup Project 
✅ Understand Routing and Implement simple routes
🗒️ I'd like to be able to determine if the request to an endpoint comes from the browser or from an hx directive
🗒️ Abstract the diverging route between hx requests and normal requests
🗒️ To be determined
